Vertical,Relevance,Insight Potential,Confidence,Ease,RICE Score,Rationale & Key Insight Angle
Real Estate,3,3,3,3,12,"Massive market. Our new PostGIS data is a huge, unique advantage. We can immediately correlate `HOUST`, `PERMIT`, and `MORTGAGE30US` with county/tract boundaries. Insight: ""Housing Stress Index by County""."
Government / Macro,3,2,3,3,11,"Core to all users. We have the most data here already (`GDP`, `CPI`, `UNRATE`). However, generating truly *unique* insights is harder as this space is crowded. Insight: ""The Real Fed Funds Rate""."
Financials,3,3,2,2,10,"Highly relevant audience. We can analyze bank health by combining `FEDFUNDS`, the yield curve (`T10Y2Y`), and financial stress (`STLFSI3`). Requires new data but is very powerful. Insight: ""Predicting Financial Stress with Yield Curve Inversions""."
Industrials,2,2,2,3,9,"Good for analyzing the ""real"" economy. We can use `INDPRO`, `PAYEMS`, and new supply chain data (`GSCPI`). Less unique than Real Estate. Insight: ""Supply Chain Pressure vs. Industrial Production""."
Consumer Discretionary,2,2,2,2,8,"Relies heavily on consumer sentiment (`UMCSENT`) and retail sales (`RSXFS`). High potential if we add credit card data. Insight: ""Consumer Sentiment vs. Actual Spending by region""."
Energy,2,3,1,2,8,"High alpha potential, especially when combined with geopolitics. However, requires sourcing new, specific commodity price data (e.g., WTI, Henry Hub), which we don't have. Insight: ""FXUSDCAD vs. WTI Crude Price""."
Materials,1,2,1,2,6,"Similar to Energy, requires new, specific commodity price data (e.g., lumber, copper). Niche but potentially valuable. Insight: ""Lumber Prices vs. Housing Starts""."
Information Technology,2,2,1,1,6,"Analysis requires deep, company-specific data (EDGAR) or high-frequency tech-sector data. High effort with our current stack. Insight: ""Semiconductor Production vs. NASDAQ""."
Communication Services,1,1,1,1,4,"Very difficult to analyze with macro data alone. Relies heavily on company-specific metrics (e.g., subscriber growth). Low-priority for now."
Health Care,1,1,1,1,4,"Highly specialized sector. Analysis requires deep regulatory and clinical trial knowledge, not just macro data. Low-priority."
Utilities,1,1,2,2,6,"A stable, regulated sector. Can be analyzed with interest rate and energy price data, but alpha potential is lower. Low-priority."
Consumer Staples,1,1,2,2,6,"Similar to Utilities, a defensive sector. Less sensitive to the macro trends we currently track. Low-priority."
