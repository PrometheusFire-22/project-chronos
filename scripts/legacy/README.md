## Bash Scripts (Deprecated)
These bash scripts are superseded by Python ingestion scripts in src/scripts/:

- bulk_ingest*.sh → Use time-series_ingest.py
- download_*.sh → Use geospatial_ingest.py (when implemented)
- load_*.sh → Use geospatial_ingest.py (when implemented)

Kept for reference only.
