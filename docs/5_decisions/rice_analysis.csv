Insight,Housing Affordability Stress Map,Real Estate,3,3,2,"3",11,Every analyst and investor cares about affordability. Granular county-level data provides a unique competitive edge over national reports. Requires new but easily accessible FRED series (Home Price/Income by county).
Insight,Construction Pipeline Pressure Index,Real Estate,3,3,2,"2",10,"A powerful leading indicator for housing supply/demand imbalance. Identifies metro areas where builder sentiment (permits) diverges from real activity (starts), signaling bottlenecks. Requires local PERMIT/HOUST data."
Insight,"The ""Rate-Lock"" Effect Visualizer",Real Estate,3,2,3,"3",11,Directly addresses a major current theme in the housing market. Simple to build with existing mortgage rate data and helps explain low housing inventory. A strong narrative tool.
Insight,Credit Risk & Housing Downturn Map,Real Estate,2,3,1,"1",7,"Extremely high alpha potential, as it could be a leading indicator for regional housing crashes. However, requires sourcing difficult-to-get county-level mortgage delinquency data. High effort, low confidence."
Insight,Rental Market Pressure Index,Real Estate,2,2,2,"2",8,"Identifies rental markets under stress, which is a key input for inflation analysis and REIT investors. Requires sourcing new metro-level CPI for Rent data from FRED."
Insight,Gentrification Leading Indicators,Real Estate,2,3,1,"1",7,"A map that correlates changes in building permits for multi-family homes with changes in local consumer spending data. A powerful but complex signal requiring highly granular, non-standard data."
Insight,Climate Risk vs. Property Value,Real Estate,3,3,1,"1",8,"A very modern and high-value insight. Involves joining property value data with climate risk data (e.g., flood plains, wildfire zones from FEMA/NRCan). Requires significant new geospatial data sourcing."
Insight,Commercial vs. Residential Divergence,Real Estate,2,2,2,"2",8,"Analyzes the post-pandemic health of Commercial Real Estate (CRE) vs. Residential. Requires sourcing CRE-specific data (e.g., vacancy rates, lease rates) and joining by metro area (CBSA)."
Insight,Canada vs. US: Provincial/State Affordability,Real Estate,2,2,2,"2",8,"A great comparative analysis tool. Requires sourcing Canadian-specific data (e.g., Teranet Home Price Index, StatCan income data) and creating a normalized affordability metric."
Insight,Infrastructure Impact on Property Values,Real Estate,1,3,1,"1",6,"Long-term analysis. Involves mapping new infrastructure projects (e.g., highways, transit lines) and measuring the change in property values in adjacent census tracts over time. Very high effort."
Vertical,Real Estate,,3,3,3,"3",12,"Massive market. Our new PostGIS data is a huge, unique advantage. We can immediately correlate `HOUST`, `PERMIT`, and `MORTGAGE30US` with county/tract boundaries. Insight: ""Housing Stress Index by County""."
Vertical,Government / Macro,,3,2,3,"3",11,"Core to all users. We have the most data here already (`GDP`, `CPI`, `UNRATE`). However, generating truly *unique* insights is harder as this space is crowded. Insight: ""The Real Fed Funds Rate""."
Vertical,Financials,,3,3,2,2,10,"Highly relevant audience. We can analyze bank health by combining `FEDFUNDS`, the yield curve (`T10Y2Y`), and financial stress (`STLFSI3`). Requires new data but is very powerful. Insight: ""Predicting Financial Stress with Yield Curve Inversions""."
Vertical,Industrials,,2,2,2,3,9,"Good for analyzing the ""real"" economy. We can use `INDPRO`, `PAYEMS`, and new supply chain data (`GSCPI`). Less unique than Real Estate. Insight: ""Supply Chain Pressure vs. Industrial Production""."
Vertical,Consumer Discretionary,,2,2,2,2,8,"Relies heavily on consumer sentiment (`UMCSENT`) and retail sales (`RSXFS`). High potential if we add credit card data. Insight: ""Consumer Sentiment vs. Actual Spending by region""."
Vertical,Energy,,2,3,1,2,8,"High alpha potential, especially when combined with geopolitics. However, requires sourcing new, specific commodity price data (e.g., WTI, Henry Hub), which we don't have. Insight: ""FXUSDCAD vs. WTI Crude Price""."
Vertical,Materials,,1,2,1,2,6,"Similar to Energy, requires new, specific commodity price data (e.g., lumber, copper). Niche but potentially valuable. Insight: ""Lumber Prices vs. Housing Starts""."
Vertical,Information Technology,,2,2,1,1,6,"Analysis requires deep, company-specific data (EDGAR) or high-frequency tech-sector data. High effort with our current stack. Insight: ""Semiconductor Production vs. NASDAQ""."
Vertical,Communication Services,,1,1,1,1,4,"Very difficult to analyze with macro data alone. Relies heavily on company-specific metrics (e.g., subscriber growth). Low-priority for now."
Vertical,Health Care,,1,1,1,1,4,"Highly specialized sector. Analysis requires deep regulatory and clinical trial knowledge, not just macro data. Low-priority."
Vertical,Utilities,,1,1,2,2,6,"A stable, regulated sector. Can be analyzed with interest rate and energy price data, but alpha potential is lower. Low-priority."
Vertical,Consumer Staples,,1,1,2,2,6,"Similar to Utilities, a defensive sector. Less sensitive to the macro trends we currently track. Low-priority."
