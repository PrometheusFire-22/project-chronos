## Problem Statement Section

### Eyebrow Text
THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM

### Headline (H2)
Traditional CRMs Show Flat Relationships. Your Network Isn't Flat.

### Pain Points (3-Column Grid)

**Column 1: Missed Connections**
- Icon: Network with broken link
- **Headline**: "Who Knows Who?"
- **Body**: LinkedIn shows direct connections. PitchBook shows deal history. But neither reveals that your LP's investment consultant sits on the board of your target company's parent. Those multi-hop paths? You're discovering them by accident—or not at all.

**Column 2: Surface-Level Data**
- Icon: Shallow water/iceberg
- **Headline**: "One-Dimensional Tracking"
- **Body**: Salesforce stores "Contact A works at Company B." What it doesn't show: Company B's co-investment patterns, geographic clustering of their portfolio, or how relationship strength decays over time. You're flying blind on the dimensions that matter.

**Column 3: Manual Research**
- Icon: Magnifying glass/spreadsheet
- **Headline**: "Hours of Spreadsheet Archaeology"
- **Body**: Cross-referencing investor lists, scraping board member data, tracking re-up rates across funds. You've spent hundreds of hours building relationship maps that are outdated the moment you finish them.

## Solution Overview Section

### Eyebrow Text
MULTI-MODAL DATABASE INTELLIGENCE

### Headline (H2)
Four Database Paradigms. One Platform. Infinite Insights.

### Subheadline
Built on PostgreSQL with Apache AGE, pgvector, TimescaleDB, and PostGIS—enterprise-proven extensions that transform how you understand your network.

### Four Pillars (2x2 Grid with Icons)

#### Pillar 1: Graph Database
- **Icon**: Network nodes with connecting edges (animated subtle pulse)
- **Headline**: "See Hidden Connection Paths"
- **Description**: Multi-hop relationship traversal reveals warm introduction routes, board network influence, and syndication patterns. Not foreign keys—native graph queries.
- **Tech Badge**: "Powered by Apache AGE"
- **Example Use Case**: "Find the 2-degree path from you to a portfolio company CEO through shared LP relationships"

#### Pillar 2: Vector Search
- **Icon**: Geometric shapes representing embeddings (3D points clustering)
- **Headline**: "Find Similar Deals Instantly"
- **Description**: AI-powered semantic search matches companies by description similarity—not tags. Discover lookalike prospects and pattern-match successful investments.
- **Tech Badge**: "Powered by pgvector"
- **Example Use Case**: "Search 'SaaS companies with strong network effects in healthcare' and get ranked results by semantic relevance"

#### Pillar 3: Geospatial Analysis
- **Icon**: Map with overlay data (purple gradient regions)
- **Headline**: "Map Regional Opportunities"
- **Description**: Overlay economic indicators, identify geographic portfolio clustering, analyze regional market trends. Your relationships have location context.
- **Tech Badge**: "Powered by PostGIS"
- **Example Use Case**: "Visualize all portfolio companies within 50 miles of high-growth tech hubs, correlated with local GDP trends"

#### Pillar 4: Time-Series Analytics
- **Icon**: Line chart with statistical annotations
- **Headline**: "Track Relationship Evolution"
- **Description**: Detect relationship decay, optimize outreach timing, analyze deal velocity trends. Relationships aren't static—neither is your data.
- **Tech Badge**: "Powered by TimescaleDB"
- **Example Use Case**: "Alert me when an LP I haven't contacted in 6 months shows declining interaction strength"

**Visual** (Left): Graph diagram showing board member overlap across portfolio companies
**Text** (Right):
- **Scenario**: "You're targeting a software company for acquisition. Your LP sits on the board of the target's largest customer."

- **Outcome**: Instead of cold outreach, you leverage existing relationship for insider perspective and warm introduction.

#### Use Case 2: Syndication Pattern Discovery
**Visual** (Right): Cluster diagram of co-investors with highlighted patterns
**Text** (Left):
- **Scenario**: "You want to identify which LPs are likely to co-invest on your next deal based on historical syndication patterns."
- **Traditional CRM**: Manual spreadsheet cross-referencing of past deals. Hours of work, outdated by next week.
- **Project Chronos**: Vector search finds similar deals by description. Graph queries show which LPs co-invested on those deals. Time-series analysis shows re-up patterns.
- **Outcome**: Ranked list of probable co-investors with strength scores. Proactive outreach to the right partners.

#### Use Case 3: Geographic Market Expansion
**Visual** (Left): Map with colored regions showing portfolio density + economic indicators
**Text** (Right):
- **Scenario**: "You want to expand into Southeast US markets but need to understand where your network has existing presence and where high-growth opportunities exist."

- **Project Chronos**: PostGIS geospatial queries cluster your portfolio companies by region. Overlay FRED economic data (GDP growth, employment trends). Identify underserved high-growth markets.
- **Outcome**: Data-driven territory expansion strategy with relationship leverage mapping.

## SEO Meta Tags

### Title Tag
`Project Chronos | Graph-Based CRM for PE/VC/IB Professionals`

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Do**:
- Use active voice ("We reveal" not "Connections are revealed")
- Be specific with numbers ($800M, 2-hop, 6 months)
- Explain technical terms simply (graph = relationships, not tables)
- Acknowledge reader's expertise (they know PE/VC pain points)
- Show the problem before the solution

**Don't**:
- Use superlatives without proof ("Best CRM ever")
- Be vague ("Industry-leading platform")
- Over-promise ("10x your deal flow")
- Assume non-technical knowledge (define graph, vector, etc.)
- Use corporate jargon ("Synergistic ecosystem")
