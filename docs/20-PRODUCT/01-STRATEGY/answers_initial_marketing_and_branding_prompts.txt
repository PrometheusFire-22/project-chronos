ANSWERS:

See attached .pdf file from Google Docs with copying and pasting of the most compelling sites, in a combination of light and dark mode (though I want harmony across both, and mobile-firstness, even though most use will be browser, and hopefully thereafter desktop).

ATTACH SAAS SAMPLES:

  Question 2a: Complete this sentence:
  "Unlike Salesforce/HubSpot which only shows lower dimensional relationship depth for understanding the extent and complexity of underlying holdings, investor relations, strength of weak connections, co-investment networks, board membership networks, board networks in relation to co-investment networks in relation to etc., Project
  Chronos reveals the multi-hop strenth of weak connections by using its uniquely multi-modal-first but running on postgres [graph/vector/geospatial
   tech] to glean unique data insights so that PE/VC/IB professionals can identify prospective investors, buyers, sellers, partners and more. Linkedin doesn't tell you who invested in Apollo Fund XII but didn't re-up with that manager for Apollo XIII. Pitchbook can tell you this but doesn't have the graph functionality to have a recommendation engine like Amazon's e-commerce or Netflix, where the recommendations are eerily good and targeted. It would also, ideally, find ways to leverage AI to answer questions but also act as a sales assistant for recommendations. Neither add such extensive geospatial and time-series features or vector".

For 2b, let's start with this:   - A) "See the Hidden Connections in Your Deal Flow" (emphasizes graph). I'm a bit concerned about the lack of clarity for this and wonder if C would be better for it's clarity, with B being too vague.

  Question 2c: Primary User Persona - Who are we writing for?

  - Partner/Principal (40-55, relationship-focused, wants efficiency)

That said, realistically, I want all of the above and I'd expect I would need to speak with the ultimate decision-makers, though there are many smaller shops where the above demographic is probably most accurate.

SEE ATTACHED MY RESUME:

  Question 3a: What's acceptable to show before you have real customers?

  For B, play up my resume but also use C. I can get legit testimonials on background and make claims about what impressive people say faithfully.
  - B) "Built by former [your background]" (your credibility)
  - C) "Powered by PostgreSQL, Apache AGE, TimescaleDB" (technical
  credibility)
  - D) Placeholder testimonials with "Investor, Undisclosed PE Firm"
  (generic but safe)

  Question 3b: Do you have any early access users, beta testers, or advisors
   we can reference (even anonymously)?

No early access users yet, I'm still launching MVP and have yet to perform the grand reveal for my former network.

 You said: "5 nodes, 5 edges forming an 'A', animated, responsive to mouse"

  Question 4a: Logo complexity - This affects everything:

Do this with absolutely no watermarks and use the color scheme discussed:

  Simple Path (Recommended for MVP):
  - Static SVG logo (5 nodes/edges forming A)
  - Subtle CSS animation (pulse or fade)
  - Fast, clean, professional
  - Timeline: 1-2 days to create

Yes to all of the logo questions below:

  Question 4b: Logo format priorities:
  1. Do you need it for the landing page hero immediately?
  2. Do you need it for favicon (browser tab icon)?
  3. Do you need it for email signatures / social media now?

  If answer is "yes" to all, we should do Simple Path first.

    Question 5a: What integrations should we show?

  Real (already planned in ADRs):
  - PostgreSQL, Apache AGE, TimescaleDB, PostGIS, pgvector
  - AWS Lightsail / S3

  Aspirational (roadmap):
  - Salesforce, HubSpot, LinkedIn
  - Bloomberg, PitchBook, Crunchbase
  - Gmail, Outlook, Calendar

  Question: Should we label these clearly as "Available Now" vs. "Coming
  Soon"? Or mix them together with small "Beta" badges?

I'm on the fence about the coming soon though I'd very much like to add this, as it's where people would get most excited, as they now expect seamless integration.

I don't want to focus on pricing for a nonexistent product. I like the more generic promises of early access and forward timing and feature guidance.

  Question 6b: Should we show pricing now (before product exists) or use:
  - "Join Waitlist" CTA
  - "Request Early Access"
  - "Coming Q1 2026"

  Question 7a: Source of graphics - Which approach?

I don't want any cheap-feeling AI made content. Ideally, I'd work with you on either a JS (likely), Python or Linux/FOSS-based graphic generator. I don't want to fall down a rabbithole here but I'm confident you and I could work together a script that essentially creates a sexier graph that something cheap-looking, and this could also have further functionality. I'm inclined to Option B but would also like Option C but would
