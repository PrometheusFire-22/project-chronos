QUICK CLEANUP:

My attempt to create a frontend structure, which failed, led me to create this file. That said, I still aspire to use this stack or similar. Should I add this to my current pyproject.toml and delete the requirements.txt file (Note that Dash was chosen for its extensibility relative to Streamlit and relative simplicity to whole JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. frontend)?

/workplace/frontend/requirements.txt:

# Core Dash libraries
dash
dash-bootstrap-components

# Data and visualization
pandas
plotly

# Database connection & Configuration
sqlalchemy
psycopg2-binary
python-dotenv
pydantic
pydantic-settings

# Logging
structlog

Does this makefile do anything? If not, can I delete it?
