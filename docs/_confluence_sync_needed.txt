Confluence Sync Required After Documentation Refactoring
============================================================

New consolidated files that need Confluence pages:

- docs/operations/integrations/google_workspace_setup.md
  Title: Google Workspace Setup & Operations
  Note: Consolidates api_setup, email_config, cli

- docs/guides/integration/google_workspace_guide.md
  Title: Google Workspace Integration Guide
  Note: Consolidates api_guide, integration patterns

- docs/operations/security/keepassxc_workflow.md
  Title: KeePassXC Workflow
  Note: Operational procedures


Old files to deprecate in Confluence:
- Mark as archived/superseded
- Add redirect to new consolidated pages
